    3: Get the number of times each movie which is available for rent has been rented and their total revenue
    4: Get the movies rental_rate that are not in the inventory.
    5: How many customers have not returned more than 1 DVD?
    6: How many movies has each customer rented?
    7: Most rented movies by genre and how much were payed for them
    8: Rental Count and Revenue by Genre and Date
    9: How many times each movie was rented by genre (for the movies which are available for rent)
    10: How many rented movies were returned late, early, and on time?
